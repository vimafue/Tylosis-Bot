# Tylosis-Bot
This code deals with the processing of micro-CT images of oak wood samples. Among other things, it includes a U-Net trained by me, which removes the tylose from the vessels. This important process facilitates the analysis of said vessels for climate-related research. This project was developed in collaboration with the German Archaeological Institute. The algorithms and the neural network are integrated into a GUI.
